           <h4>I started DM campus chapters to inspire students to stand up to the big money interests corrupting our democracy and to fight  against voter suppression. I believe students can be a powerful voice in the pro-democracy movement sweeping the country.</h4>

       <p>The NBA has recognized Foyle three times for his commitment to democracy with nationally televised presentations of their “Community Assist Award.” The Greenlining Institute presented him with their prestigious Change Agent Award, and he received the City of San Francisco’s Sports Hero Award.
